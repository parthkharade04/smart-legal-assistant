2. ACCESS AND USE.
   2.1 Provision of Access. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Provider hereby grants to Customer a non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, non-transferable (except as provided in Section 10.2) right to access and use the Services during the Term, solely for Customer's internal business operations.
   2.2 Usage Limits. Services are subject to usage limits, including, for example, the quantities specified in Order Forms. If Customer exceeds a contractual usage limit, Provider may work with Customer to seek to reduce Customer’s usage so that it conforms to that limit. If, notwithstanding Provider’s efforts, Customer is unable or unwilling to abide by a contractual usage limit, Customer will execute an Order Form for additional quantities of the applicable Services promptly upon Provider’s request.

3. CONFIDENTIALITY; DATA PROTECTION.
   3.1 Confidentiality. Each party (the "Receiving Party") understands that the other party (the "Disclosing Party") has disclosed or may disclose business, technical, or financial information relating to the Disclosing Party’s business (hereinafter referred to as "Proprietary Information"). Proprietary Information of Provider includes non-public information regarding features, functionality, and performance of the Service. The Receiving Party agrees: (i) to take reasonable precautions to protect such Proprietary Information, and (ii) not to use (except in performance of the Services or as otherwise permitted herein) or divulge to any third person any such Proprietary Information.
   3.2 Data Security. Provider shall maintain appropriate administrative, physical, and technical safeguards for protection of the security, confidentiality, and integrity of Customer Data. Provider shall not modify Customer Data, disclose Customer Data except as compelled by law or as expressly permitted in writing by Customer, or access Customer Data except to provide the Services or prevent or address service or technical problems.

4. TERM AND TERMINATION.
   4.1 Term. This Agreement commences on the Effective Date and continues until all subscriptions granted in accordance with this Agreement have expired or been terminated (the "Term"). The initial subscription term shall be for a period of three (3) years (the "Initial Term").
   4.2 Renewal. Except as otherwise specified in the applicable Order Form, all subscriptions will automatically renew for additional periods equal to the expiring subscription term or one year (whichever is shorter), unless either party gives the other notice of non-renewal at least thirty (30) days before the end of the relevant subscription term.
   4.3 Termination for Cause. A party may terminate this Agreement for cause: (i) upon 30 days written notice to the other party of a material breach if such breach remains uncured at the expiration of such period, or (ii) if the other party becomes the subject of a petition in bankruptcy or any other proceeding relating to insolvency, receivership, liquidation, or assignment for the benefit of creditors.
   4.4 Refund or Payment upon Termination. If this Agreement is terminated by Customer in accordance with Section 4.3 (Termination for Cause), Provider will refund Customer any prepaid fees covering the remainder of the term of all Order Forms after the effective date of termination. If this Agreement is terminated by Provider in accordance with Section 4.3, Customer will pay any unpaid fees covering the remainder of the term of all Order Forms. In no event will termination relieve Customer of its obligation to pay any fees payable to Provider for the period prior to the effective date of termination.

Except as otherwise specified herein or in an Order Form, (i) fees are based on the Services subscriptions purchased and not actual usage, (ii) payment obligations are non-cancelable and fees paid are non-refundable, and (iii) quantities purchased cannot be decreased during the relevant subscription term.

6. INDEMNIFICATION.
   6.1 Indemnification by Provider. Provider will defend Customer against any claim, demand, suit or proceeding made or brought against Customer by a third party alleging that the use of a Service in accordance with this Agreement infringes or misappropriates such third party’s intellectual property rights (a "Claim Against Customer"), and will indemnify Customer from any damages, attorney fees and costs finally awarded against Customer as a result of, or for amounts paid by Customer under a settlement approved by Provider in writing of, a Claim Against Customer, provided Customer (a) promptly gives Provider written notice of the Claim Against Customer, (b) gives Provider sole control of the defense and settlement of the Claim Against Customer (except that Provider may not settle any Claim Against Customer unless it unconditionally releases Customer of all liability), and (c) gives Provider all reasonable assistance, at Provider’s expense.

7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
   7.1 Limitation of Liability. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AGGREGATE LIABILITY OF EACH PARTY TOGETHER WITH ALL OF ITS AFFILIATES ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED THE TOTAL AMOUNT PAID BY CUSTOMER HEREUNDER FOR THE SERVICES GIVING RISE TO THE LIABILITY IN THE TWELVE MONTHS PRECEDING THE FIRST INCIDENT OUT OF WHICH THE LIABILITY AROSE.
   7.2 Exclusion of Consequential and Related Damages. IN NO EVENT WILL EITHER PARTY HAVE ANY LIABILITY TO THE OTHER PARTY FOR ANY LOST PROFITS, REVENUES, OR INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, COVER, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, WHETHER AN ACTION IS IN CONTRACT OR TORT AND REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, EVEN IF A PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
